## **Google Apps Script Automation for Client and Physician Confirmation Letters**

This repository contains a Google Apps Script project that automates the creation and distribution of operational docuements via integrating Google Docs and Gmail for both clients (e.g., Bay Health Hospital) and physicians. The script converts Google Docs into PDFs and sends them to the respective recipients via Gmail.

### **Objective**
To streamline the process of creating and sending confirmation letters by automating:
- **Client Confirmation Letters** (e.g., Bay Health Hospital)
- **Physician Confirmation Letters**

This automation reduces manual effort and ensures timely delivery of all confirmation letters.

### **How It Works**
1. **Google Docs**: The script retrieves the respective confirmation letter from Google Docs (client or physician specific).
2. **PDF Conversion**: It converts the document into PDF format using Google Apps Script.
3. **Gmail Integration**: The PDFs are automatically emailed to either the clients (e.g., hospitals) or the physicians.
4. **Base Sheet for Apps Script**: You can view the analyzed data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqdwxgSTjNv6hPni_RG2SySkHoVyKJ355_DTpdDiYz4FZWozYkwNI_jXGLI2L93ekADfM4vm-epT1f/pubhtml).

### **Key Features**
- **Automated PDF Creation**: Converts Google Docs into PDFs for both clients and physicians.
- **Automated Emailing**: Sends the confirmation letters via Gmail.
- **Dual Use Case**: Handles both client and physician workflows, ensuring timely and accurate letter distribution.

### **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository and open the script in Google Apps Script.
2. Replace the placeholder document IDs and email addresses with your own.
3. Deploy and execute the script to automate the sending of confirmation letters.
